# gPodderMetadata

Populates the metadata of gPodder downloads based on the filename in such a way that they play nicely with Plex. The podcast is the artist, the year is the album, month is the disc, then a track is assigned in chronlogical order. If the script has previously been run, it will update only new podcasts.
